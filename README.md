# PicTune.
PicTune is a Desktop application built using Electron.JS to help resize an image through adjusting the percentage quality of the pic they wish to attain.
after the size adjusting has been complete, the new adjusted picture is then stored in a seperate folder for easy access, with the path to the picture displayed at the bottom of the app.
